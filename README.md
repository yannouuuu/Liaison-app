# Liaison ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰âš¡

Liaison is a unique application designed to facilitate the learning of 3D and 2D kinematic linkages and kinematic pairs, along with the study of kinematic torques. Whether you are a student, engineer, or enthusiast, Liaison provides an interactive platform to explore and understand mechanical linkages and kinematic concepts.

## Features

- **3D and 2D Kinematic Linkages:** Visualize and interact with various kinematic linkages in both 3D and 2D environments.

- **Kinematic Pairs:** Study different types of kinematic pairs and understand their mechanical characteristics.

- **Kinematic Torque Analysis:** Dive into the world of kinematic torques and enhance your understanding of mechanical systems.

## Built With

Liaison is crafted using cutting-edge technologies to provide a seamless user experience. The key technologies include:

- **ReactJS:** Building the user interface and managing the application state efficiently with ReactJS.

- **TypeScript:** Enhancing code readability, maintainability, and catching potential errors early with TypeScript.

- **Tauri 2.0 alpha:** Leveraging Tauri for cross-platform compatibility, Liaison is supported on both Android and iOS devices.

- **Shadcn UI:** Aesthetic and user-friendly interface design powered by Shadcn UI.

- **TailwindCSS:** Streamlined and responsive styling with the help of TailwindCSS.

- **Vite:** Fast and efficient development with Vite as the build tool.
